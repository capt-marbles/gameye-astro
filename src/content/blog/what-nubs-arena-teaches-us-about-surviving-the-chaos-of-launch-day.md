When Nubs!: Arena launched, demand rose to roughly three times forecast expectations. The takeaway was clear: launch-day resilience depends more on infrastructure flexibility than prediction precision.

## Forecasts are useful, not sufficient

Wishlist and pre-launch intent data can guide planning, but they rarely model virality and sudden region-specific spikes.

## Design for chaos, not perfect control

Rangatang and Glowfish Interactive prepared for uncertainty by using dynamic orchestration. This let them scale into unexpected region demand without manual server scrambling.

> “Gameye was always very responsive… things went very smoothly.”

## Test in production-like conditions

Pre-launch testing that mirrors real-world traffic behavior helps uncover edge cases that internal QA passes will miss.

Key practices:

- Test across multiple regions.
- Simulate volatility and concurrency spikes.
- Validate logs and debugging workflows before launch.

## Practical launch guidance

- Do not overfit capacity plans to wishlist counts.
- Validate infrastructure behavior under strain.
- Use flexible orchestration policies.
- Prepare deterministic logging and debugging paths for live incidents.

Launch-day success often comes from preparation for uncertainty, not certainty about demand.
